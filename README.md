**BlanketCon '23** was an in-minecraft virtual event that ran from August 26th through August 29th, 2023.

This modpack contains all mods from the event - and the convention world, packed with community-made booths!

**Key Features**:
- Check out 137 convention "booths" built to show off mods, modpacks, and other modding projects!
- Explore a contrasting solarpunk / cyberpunk world loosely fictionalized based on the real-life city of Lisbon! 
- Traverse the map by trains, trams, and cars - plus on foot with odd food, slippery shoes, and more!
- Find and earn 298 collectible "shards", tracking booth visits, hidden secrets, and tricky challenges!
- Revisit the world where it all went down - or just check it out for the first time!
- Experience the crushing ennui of late-stage capitalism! (huh?)
